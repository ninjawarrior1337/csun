		<h2>Hey, Treelar here</h2>
		<p>
			Originally the plan for this website was to setup GH actions
			and build and upload to the CSUN server on push.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, <span class="text-green-400">Duo</span> MFA is <b>forced</b> on
			SSH authentication instead of permitting ssh-key authentication leaving me
			no way to automatically update this page.
		</p>
		<i class="text-sm">ssh-key auth worked during the 2021 - 2022 semesters, idk why staff decided to break it now</i>
		<p>
			So instead of having a cool distinct site that I might've updated every so often, 
			you get this website
			that tells you to go to my main site.
		</p>

		<a href="https://treelar.xyz" class="font-extrabold text-5xl no-underline bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-muse via-treelar to-treelar">treelar.xyz</a>

		<p>But hey, since you came all this way, heres a fun little counter to play with. (It probably doesn't do anything, but its still there none the less)</p>

		<Counter client:idle/>

		<p>Alright, thats it, signing off.</p>

		<h2>Update: 5/5/23</h2>

		<p>I GOT DEPLOYMENTS WORKING</p>
		<p>
			Using a what I'm almost sure is a very insecure PHP script, I can now use GH to deploy to this server
			bypassing both the login and 2FA requirements.
		</p>
		<p>
			This site is open source here:
			<a href="https://github.com/ninjawarrior1337/csun" target="_blank">https://github.com/ninjawarrior1337/csun</a>
			along with the PHP used to `backdoor` the server.
		</p>
		<p>
			This and all pages from now on will be archived including this funny letter about how I thought remote deployment
			was gonna be impossible will be under the directory /proto.

			Look forward to seeing stuff here soon.
		</p>

		<p>Signing off.</p>
