# Fission

## A less shitty barcode generator for the SRC.

Be you, about to work out at the SRC, you launch the app, and then you realize, holy shit this app sucks.

You don't have to take my word for it, just look at these _rave_ reviews from both the App Store and Play Store.

<Image class="border-2 rounded border-muse" src={appstore} alt="low rating of csun src app on the appstore"/>
<Image class="border-2 rounded border-muse" src={playstore} alt="low rating of csun src app on the play store"/>

Enter <span class="text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-muse to-treelar bg-clip-text">Fission</span>, a modern
reimagining of the barcode generator app with only exactly what you need.

Written in Flutter and sporting a modern, accessible Material 3 UI, this app is your perfect companion for working out.

You can download it by using [this F-Droid repo](https://fs.treelar.xyz/fdroid/repo/).

Sorry, no iOS version until Apple lets users sideload.

Web (PWA) version comming soon.
